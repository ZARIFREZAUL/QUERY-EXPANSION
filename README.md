# QUERY-EXPANSION

Query expansion(QE) is the process of reformulating a given query to improve retrieval performance in information retrieval operations. Information retrieval(IR) is the activity of obtaining information system resources relevant to an information need from a collection of information resources.


As Pipilika Search Engine is the first Bengali search engine, it is highly expected that it should provide an efficient searching service to its user. A better Query expansion method can provide a better Searching experience.



We are motivated in this research topics because of two faults in Pipilika Search Engine:


Unexpected Query Results: 

We cannot get the exact result which we expect in Pipilika Search Engine when we use a portion of our information as a search key.

Lack of Intelligent Query Results: 

We have observed that the query results that we retrieved by performing a search are not intelligent search results.
Those results are unable to fulfill users expected search information in some cases.



In QUERY_EXPANSION_PIPILIKA.py File will give you a expand query for a search key with some example.
